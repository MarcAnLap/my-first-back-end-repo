Setup Instructions for Groups and Permissions
To set up initial permissions:

Run setup_groups() to create groups and assign permissions, if not already configured.
Adjust permissions based on application requirements (e.g., allow Admins to add menu items).
This should serve as a foundational structure. 
You may wish to expand each section with example request/response pairs and any additional setup instructions for specific permissions.
